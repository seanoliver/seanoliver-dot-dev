        <p className='leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6'>
          I'm a Growth Engineer at{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://supabase.com/'>Supabase</UnderLink>, where I
          blend technical expertise with user insights to build experiences that
          actually move the needle.
        </p>
        <p className='leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6'>
          My path here was unconventional — I spent a decade growing products at{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://www.microsoft.com/'>Microsoft</UnderLink>,{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://www.linkedin.com/'>LinkedIn</UnderLink>,{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://www.lyft.com/'>Lyft</UnderLink>, and{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://www.block.xyz/'>Block</UnderLink> before
          diving headfirst into engineering. Most recently at{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://gamma.app/'>Gamma</UnderLink>, I helped build
          AI-powered tools that make creating and sharing ideas effortless.
        </p>
        <p className='leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6'>
          What drives me is the intersection of human behavior and code — running
          experiments, digging into usage patterns, and crafting features that
          feel inevitable rather than forced. I work primarily with React,
          Next.js, and TypeScript, but I'm most excited when I'm turning data
          into decisions and hypotheses into shipped features.
        </p>
        <p className='leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6'>
          I also write a{' '}
          <UnderLink href='https://newsletter.seanoliver.dev/'>
            newsletter
          </UnderLink>{' '}
          about programming, productivity, and personal knowledge management.

        <p className='leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6'>
          I live in San Francisco, CA with my wife, two kids, and our 3.5-pound
          dog, Pixel (no relation to the phone). Outside of work, I love
          exploring productivity tools, experimenting with AI side projects,
          playing tennis, and designing casual mobile games.
