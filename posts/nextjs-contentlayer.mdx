[Contentlayer](https://www.Contentlayer.dev/) is a content SDK that makes it easy to import content from Markdown and MDX into your Next.js app.

A few reasons why I love it:

- It's fully typesafe and TypeScript-first
- Supports live reload of content changes in development
- [Treats content as data](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/concepts/content-modeling-dc68721f), so you can use it in your app however you want
- Supports both Markdown and [MDX](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/sources/files/mdx-d747e46d) with frontmatter

Contentlayer was created by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) co-founder [Johannes Schickling](https://www.schickling.dev/), but due to [issues](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/stackbit-joins-netlify) outside of his control, Johannes has had to [scale back his time spent maintaining](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429) the project.

As a result, there are some unresolved issues and a few things can be a little tricky to figure out. I think it's still a great project, so I wanted to write this guide to help others get started with it based on what I've learned.

## Getting Started

Let's assume you already have an existing Next.js app. If not, you can create one with the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
cd my-contentlayer-app
```

Next, install Contentlayer, `next-contentlayer`, and `date-fns`, a helper package for dealing with dates:

```bash
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer date-fns
```

Next, create a `contentlayer.config.ts` file in the root of your project with the following contents:

```tsx
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';
import rehypePrettyCode from 'rehype-pretty-code';

const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
	name: 'Post',
	filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
	contentType: 'mdx',
	fields: {
		title: {
			type: 'string',
			description: 'The title of the post',
			required: true,
		},
		date: {
			type: 'date',
			description: 'The date of the post',
			required: true,
		},
		isPublished: {
			type: 'boolean',
			description: 'Whether the post is published',
			required: true,
		},
	},
	computedFields: {
		url: {
			type: 'string',
			resolve: doc => `/${doc._raw.flattenedPath}`,
		},
		slug: {
			type: 'string',
			resolve: doc => doc._raw.flattenedPath,
		},
		author: {
			type: 'string',
			resolve: () => 'Sean Oliver',
		},
	},
}));

/** @type {import('rehype-pretty-code').Options} */
const options = {
	theme: 'nord',
};

export default makeSource({
	contentDirPath: 'posts',
	documentTypes: [Post],
	mdx: {
		remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
		rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, options]],
	},
});
```
