Anchor links, also known as "jump links" or "in-page links," let users navigate to specific sections within a webpage. They're especially useful for content-heavy pages and also improve accessibility. However, the default behavior can be jarringâ€”clicking one snaps you to the target section without any smooth transition.

To elevate user experience, it's possible to add smooth scrolling to anchor links. I recently swapped out the [`react-scroll`](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll) library for a custom setup using React's built-in hooks. Here's how you can do it too.

### Requirements

Here's a checklist of what you'll need:

1. **Scroll Target**: The DOM element you're scrolling to.
2. **Scroll Function**: Callback function for the `onClick` event.
3. **Offset**: Optional top offset to avoid header overlap.
4. **Smooth Scrolling**: Basic CSS for easing effects.

### Using React Hooks

React Hooks make this task a cinch, offering you a native solution without third-party dependencies. This enhances your app's longevity and minimizes maintenance efforts.

#### `useContext`

This hook is optional but recommended if your site has a layout component containing the nav header and target sections split out into separate components (as [mine](https://github.com/seanoliver/seanoliver-dot-dev/blob/main/src/components/navigation.tsx) does). `useContext` simplifies passing down refs through the component tree.

```tsx
// use-nav-context.tsx
import { createContext, useContext, createRef } from 'react';
import { NavRefsProps } from '@/lib/types';

export const NavContext = createContext<NavRefsProps>({
  Posts: createRef(),
  About: createRef(),
  Projects: createRef(),
  Experience: createRef(),
});

export const useNavContext = () => useContext(NavContext);
```

Wrap your root layout component with `NavContext.Provider`:

```tsx
// layout.tsx
import { NavContext } from '@/hooks/use-nav-context';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <NavContext.Provider value={navRefs}>
          {children}
        </NavContext.Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To access `NavContext` in deeply nested components, use the `useNavContext` hook:

```tsx
// NavLink.tsx
function NavLink({ name }: { name: string }): JSX.Element {
  const refs = useNavContext();

  return (
    <Link href="#" onClick={() => (refs[name] ? handleScroll(refs[name]) : null)}>
      {name}
    </Link>
  );
}
```

#### `useRef`

`useRef` is where the real magic happens. It lets you hold a reference to DOM elements in a React-friendly manner.

```tsx
// NavLink.tsx
function NavLink({ scroll }: { scroll: boolean }): JSX.Element {
  const refs = useNavContext();

  const handleScroll = (ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>) => {
    const element = ref.current;
    if (element) {
      window.scrollTo({
        top: element.offsetTop - 50,
        behavior: 'smooth',
      });
    }
  };

  const linkProps = scroll
    ? { href: "#", onClick: () => (refs[name] ? handleScroll(refs[name]) : null) }
    : { href: url };

  return (
    <>
      <Link {...linkProps}>
        {name}
      </Link>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Smooth Scrolling Using `window.scrollTo`

You can achieve smooth scrolling directly via JavaScript by utilizing the `window.scrollTo` function. The function accepts an options object where you can specify `top` and `left` positions along with `behavior`.

Call this function from nav link component:

```tsx
window.scrollTo({
  top: element.offsetTop - 50,
  behavior: 'smooth',
});
```

- `top`: This is the vertical scroll position in pixels. `element.offsetTop` gives you the distance of the element from the top of its parent. We subtract 50 pixels to account for any fixed header or margin you may have.

- `behavior`: Setting it to `smooth` ensures that the scrolling effect is animated and not abrupt. This mimics the CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth;` but offers more control since you're doing it programmatically.

By using `window.scrollTo` this way, you bypass the need to set CSS properties like `scroll-behavior`, giving you fine-grained control over the scroll functionality.

The scrolling behavior itself is pretty efficient. However, if your page has numerous elements or complex layouts, consider using throttling or debouncing techniques to control the frequency of scroll events.

### Wrapping Up

Using React's built-in hooks, you can efficiently create smooth scrolling anchor links. You'll avoid third-party library risks, keep your component tree clean, and most importantly, deliver a refined user experience. Your users will find it easier to navigate your long, content-rich pages, and you get to maintain a leaner, more robust codebase.
